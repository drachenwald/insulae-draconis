# Ascending the Principality thrones

<p>An armoured combat Coronet Tournament (often shortened to 'tourney') is fought every nine months to determine who will be the next pair to wear the Coronets of Insulae Draconis. Any authorised armoured fighter who is a fully paid member of the SCA and who has the support of a consort (also a fully paid up member) can fight. The tournament will be officially announced and fighters must give formal notification of their intention to enter with a  <a href="{% link coronet/coronet-tourney.md %}#submit-a-letter-of-intent">Letter of Intent</a>.</p> 

[Learn more about what is needed to host a Coronet tournament](https://insulaedraconis.org/library/group-resources/bidding-for-events/), and [contact the Principality Seneschal](seneschal@insulaedraconis.org) for more information about submitting an event proposal.


# Be a contender

The thrones of Insulae Draconis must be won by right of arms, and the tourney is always an [Armoured Combat Tourney]({% link activities/armoured-combat/index.md %}). The tourney itself takes place at different locations around Insulae Draconis, and is part of a weekend of activities. This is a great event to meet people from other Shires as people make a special effort to attend to see who will be our next Coronet pair and to celebrate with them. 

## Be inspired by a consort

Every fighter needs inspiration, someone who motivates them to seek the throne in their honour. When you enter Coronet you are doing so as a partnership willing to take on the responsibility of the Thrones of Insulae Draconis in the event of the fighter winning the tourney. The rules below apply to both the fighter and their inspiration.  

## Submit a Letter of intent

A letter of intent is simply a note telling Their Highnesses that you wish to enter the tournament.

To be eligible to fight you must [be an SCA member](https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk) and that membership must be up-to-date. If you'd like to enter and don't meet the requirements by the deadline for letters of intent, but will have done so by the day of the tournament, please submit your letter of intent and explain what is going on. Submitting a letter of intent does not require you to fight; it just lets us know that you intend to do so, and allows us time to do the necessary paperwork. The Victor and Consort must maintain their memberships to the society and subscription(s) to the Baelfyr, without lapse, throughout their tenure.

- Both parties must be subscribed to the [Baelfyr]({% link baelfyr/index.md %}) 
- The fighter must be an authorised heavy weapons fighter in the Kingdom of Drachenwald and bring their authorisation card to the tournament.
- Both parties must be eighteen years of age or older.
- Both parties must have attended Principality events listed in the [Dragon's Tale](https://drachenwald.sca.org/offices/chronicler/kingdom-newsletter/) and resided in Insulae Draconis for more than six months
